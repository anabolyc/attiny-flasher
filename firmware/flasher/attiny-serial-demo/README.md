## attiny-serial-demo

This is basic led-blinking and/or serial messaging app that is used to verify [ATtiny Flasher](https://sonocotta.com/attiny-flasher/) capabilities to flash different MCUs. 

It is based on Arduino Framework and therefore is not compatible with all the supported MCUs, but it is quite usefull for testing and debugging purposes
