## Introduction

This is debugging firmware code for [ATtiny Flasher](https://sonocotta.com/attiny-flasher/).

This is basic led-blinking and/or serial messaging app that is used to verify [ATtiny Flasher](https://sonocotta.com/attiny-flasher/) capabilities to flash different MCUs. It is also a source of Platformio configuration samples for different target MCUs.

It designed to be flashed to TARGET MCU, and currently tested on
- ATtinyx5 series
- ATtiny20 using TPI
- ATtiny412 using UPDI
- Atmegax28 series

It is based on Arduino Framework and therefore is not compatible with all the supported MCUs, but it is quite usefull for testing and debugging purposes
