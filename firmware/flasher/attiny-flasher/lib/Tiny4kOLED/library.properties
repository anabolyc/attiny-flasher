sentence=This is a library for an ATTiny85 to use an I2C SSD1306 OLED. It supports double buffering on 128x32 pixel OLED.
paragraph=The SSD1306 has enough RAM to support a 128 by 64 pixel display, and most SSD1306 controlled OLEDs are 128 by 64 pixels. However there are also other display sizes available. With a 128 by 32 pixel display, only half of the SSD1306's RAM is used, and the other half can be used as a frame buffer. This results in being able to have a slow ATTiny85 gradually update the display, then switch it into view when it is ready. Screens of other resolutions are supported by this library but only support double buffering if they are 32 pixels in height.
