## attiny-flasher

This is firmware code for [ATtiny Flasher](https://sonocotta.com/attiny-flasher/).

It is based on Arduino Framework and currently cupports ISP flasing using STK500v1 protocol in both high voltage and low voltage modes.

I'm trying to keep support of all board revisions to simplify board development and testing, therefore list of build configurations is growing all the time. 

Each new revision of the board is adding some capabilities and more code required to support added features.
