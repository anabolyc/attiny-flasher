## attiny-serial-demo

This is basic led-blinking and/or serial messaging app that is used to verify [ATtiny Flasher](https://sonocotta.com/attiny-flasher/) capabilities to flash different MCUs. 

It is not using any frameworks but works directly on HW and therefore it is compatible with all the supported MCUs. It is quite usefull for testing and debugging purposes.
