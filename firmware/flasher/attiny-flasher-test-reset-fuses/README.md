## Introduction

This is debugging firmware code for [ATtiny Flasher](https://sonocotta.com/attiny-flasher/).

It's purpose is to test high voltage programming mode, specifically routine to reset fuses (usually when reset-disabled fuses were flashed, and low-voltage programming no longer works).

It uses Serial communication to steer programming of the target MCU.
